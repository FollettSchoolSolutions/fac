#Angular component library documentation
This library is licensed under the MIT license.

This project houses documentation / examples on usage of the FSS Angular component library.

To contribute to the examples:

* Check out the project
* Add the new component to its' own directory under the examples directory
* This can vary depending on the component, but generally you want to perform the following
  * Add a js file named featureEx.js
  * Add an html file named featureEx.html
* Edit the index.html file and copy the block between "Begin feature example" and "End feature example"
* Change the dd and li tags to reference the feature name you are adding (i.e., #truncateHtml, #truncateJS, truncateHtmlTab, truncateJSTab, etc)
* Start the test server to preview your changes by typing 'ant startServer' in the server directory
* Point a browser to "http://localhost:9000" to verify that the newly added example displays correctly
