##Development
####Pre-requisites to building the project
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
* Bower
  * `npm install -g bower`
* Grunt
  * `npm install -g grunt-cli`

####Contributing

* Clone the project and create a new branch off of master
* Add the new component to its' own directory under one of the broad categories (directives/filters etc, adding a new category if applicable)
* Add the new spec file for your component to a directory named 'test' as a subfolder of the above directory
  * Look at the existing components for an example of this if you are unsure where this goes
* Test and lint it by typing `grunt` in the project root directory
* Debug the test suite in a Chrome browser by typing `grunt debug`
* Build it by typing `grunt build`. This will create a 'dist' folder with the following files:
  * projectname.js (Unminified javascript file containing concatenated result of all js files, including any directive html files)
  * projectname.min.js (Minified version of the above file)
  * projectname.css  (Unminified css file containing concatenated result of all css files)
  * projectname.min.css  (Minified version of the above file)
* Commit your changes (including files in dist) and submit a pull request to master
* After the pull request is merged, create a new release:
  * `grunt bump`
  * This will bump the patch version of the bower.json and package.json as well as create a tag for the new version and will automatically commit and push all changes.
  * If your changes are for a new minor release (meaning there are significant, yet backwards-compatible changes) use `grunt bump:minor`
  * If your changes are for a new major release (meaning there are breaking changes) use `grunt bump:major` 

* Checkout the [docs](https://github.com/FollettSchoolSolutions/fac/tree/gh-pages) project by switching to the gh-pages branch
* Follow the instructions for that project on how to add a simple usage example to the existing page
