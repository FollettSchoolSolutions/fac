#Angular component library
This library is licensed under the MIT license.

This project houses components helpful to general application development with AngularJS.  The goal is to provide a collection of common services/directive/filters, etc
that can be pulled into your projects and modified or used as is.
###Versions
1.0
 
* Compatible with AngularJS 1.0.7

1.1

* Compatible with AngularJS 1.2.4

[Documentation](http://follettschoolsolutions.github.io/fac/)

[Binaries](https://github.com/FollettSchoolSolutions/fac/tree/gh-pages)

####Pre-requisites to building the project
* Ant 1.8.2 is used, prior versions may work
* PhatomJS version 1.4.0 is used for running tests from the command line, although you don't have to have it installed in order to build the project
To contribute:

* Check out the project
* Add the new component to its' own directory under one of the broad categories (directives/filters etc, adding a new category if applicable)
* Add the new spec file for your component to a directory named 'test' as a subfolder of the above directory
  * Look at the existing components for an example of this if you are unsure where this goes
* Build it by typing 'ant' in the project root directory
* Update the project.version property in the build.properties file
* Start the test server by typing 'ant startServer' 
* Run the tests in one of the following ways

  Point a browser to "http://localhost:9000/test/runner.html"

  -or-

  type 'ant test' (this requires PhantomJS to be installed)

* Checkout the [docs](https://github.com/FollettSchoolSolutions/fac/tree/gh-pages) project by switching to the gh-pages branch
* Follow the instructions for that project on how to add a simple usage example to the existing page

A build will produce the following output files in the 'output' folder:

* projectname.js (Unminified javascript file containing concatenated result of all js files, including any directive html files)
* projectname-min.js (Minified version of the above file)
* graph.css  (css for use by the bargraph directive)


###PhantomJS for command line test runs
In order to run the tests with the headless browser PhantomJS, you will need to install PhantomJS.  You may either put phantomjs on your PATH, or if not:

* Modify build.properties - change the phantom.js.bin property to reflect the absolute path to the phantomjs binary.  

  i.e.

  `phantom.js.bin=/usr/local/bin/phantomjs`

  or for Windows

  `phantom.js.bin=c:\\tools\\phantomjs-1.9.2-windows\\phantomjs`
